1/ What is responsible for defining the routes of the games resource?

server/helpers/create_router.js


2/ What do you notice about the folder structure? Whats the client responsible for? Whats the server responsible for?

Client is responsible for components, display, the form, the state
server is responsible for taking data and passing it to the database, either through GETs or POSTs or DELETEs


3/ What are the the responsibilities of server.js?

Creating the router through ./helpers/create_router
Connecting to the database
getting the server to listen.


4/ What are the responsibilities of the gamesRouter?

It is an instance of the class router, defined in ./helpers/create_router
It handles GETs POSTs and DELETEs



5/ What process does the the client (front-end) use to communicate with the server?

Restful Routes, Posts, Gets etc

6/ What optional second argument does the fetch method take? And what is it used for in this application? Hint: See Using Fetch on the MDN docs

An object containing any custom settings that you want to apply to the request.
You can add method, body, headers, mode (cors no-cors etc)

example from code - {
      method: 'POST',
      body: JSON.stringify(payload),
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json'}
    }


7/ Which of the games API routes does the front-end application consume (i.e. make requests to)?

GET POST DELETE 



8/ What are we using the MongoDB Driver for?





9/ Why do we need to use [`ObjectId`](https://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/api-bson-generated/objectid.html) from the MongoDB driver?

because we don't know the layout of the data in the database. 
We could have 2 documents with the same property 'name'.
If we used something like 'name' of the game to find or delete a document, we might delete or find the wrong one. 


10/ Add to your diagram the dataflow for removing a game.
